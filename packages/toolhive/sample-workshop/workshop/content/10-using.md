title: Using it
---

Once the Toolhive CLI `thv` extension pack is configured in your workshop manifest,
it will be injected and staged into your workshop session during its start up,
placed in the PATH, and with auto-completion enabled.

To verify the CLI functions correctly,

```execute
thv version
```

For bonus points,
try out autocomplete by typing the partial `thv` command and `version` subcommand.
